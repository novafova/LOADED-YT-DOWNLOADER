# Download Improvements for Loaded YouTube Downloader

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Long Video Download Problems (5+ minutes)
**Problem**: Videos longer than 5 minutes were failing to download or timing out.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Extended Timeouts**: Increased download timeout to 30 minutes for very long videos
- **Retry Logic**: Added automatic retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts) for network failures
- **Progress Throttling**: Limited progress updates to every 500ms to reduce overhead
- **Memory Management**: Implemented 1MB buffer size for better performance with large files
- **User Warnings**: Added duration warnings for videos longer than 30 minutes

### 2. Audio/Video Synchronization Issues
**Problem**: High-quality video downloads sometimes didn't include audio or had sync issues.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Separate Stream Detection**: Automatically detects when video and audio need to be downloaded separately (common for 1080p+ videos)
- **Smart Format Selection**: Prioritizes combined video+audio formats when available
- **FFmpeg Merging**: Uses FFmpeg to properly merge separate video and audio streams
- **Quality Matching**: Ensures the best audio quality is paired with selected video quality
- **Fallback Logic**: Multiple fallback options if preferred formats aren't available

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
**New Features**:
- **Network Error Recovery**: Automatic retry for connection timeouts, DNS failures, and socket errors
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delay between retry attempts
- **Partial File Cleanup**: Removes incomplete downloads on failure
- **Detailed Error Messages**: More informative error messages for troubleshooting

### 4. Improved Progress Tracking
**New Features**:
- **Multi-Stage Progress**: Shows separate progress for video download, audio download, and merging
- **Status Messages**: Displays current operation (downloading video, downloading audio, merging, converting)
- **Better Time Estimates**: More accurate progress reporting for long downloads

## Technical Improvements

### Download Process Flow
1. **Video Info Retrieval**: Enhanced with timeout and retry logic
2. **Format Selection**: Smart selection based on target quality and availability
3. **Download Strategy**:
   - **Combined Format**: Single download if video+audio format exists
   - **Separate Streams**: Download video and audio separately, then merge with FFmpeg
4. **Progress Reporting**: Real-time updates with operation status
5. **Format Conversion**: Optional conversion to target format after download
6. **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of temporary files

## Usage Notes

### For Long Videos (5+ minutes)
- The app will now warn users about long videos and estimated download time
- High-quality downloads (1080p+) may require separate video and audio downloads
- Progress will show multiple stages: video download → audio download → merging

### For High-Quality Downloads (1080p+)
- The app automatically detects when separate streams are needed
- FFmpeg merges video and audio streams seamlessly
- Final output maintains selected quality and format

### Error Recovery
- Network issues trigger automatic retries (up to 3 attempts)
- Users see retry status in progress messages
- Partial downloads are cleaned up automatically on failure

## Testing

A test script (`test-download.js`) is included to verify the improvements work correctly. Run it with:

```bash
node test-download.js
```

## Performance Expectations

- **Short videos (< 5 min)**: Should download quickly as before
- **Medium videos (5-15 min)**: May take longer for high quality due to separate streams
- **Long videos (15+ min)**: Will show progress through multiple stages, but should complete successfully
- **Very long videos (60+ min)**: User will be warned and asked to confirm before starting

The improvements prioritize reliability over speed, ensuring downloads complete successfully even for challenging videos.
